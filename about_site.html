            The idea to create this personal homepage germinated
            during a visit to Paris in September 2022.   
            On a month-long stay in Paris in September 2022, I purchased an introductory book on HTML/CSS called <i>Introduction à HTML et CSS</i> by Éric Sarrion at the multistory bookstore Gibert Joseph on Boulevard Saint Michel. I recommend visiting this bookstore if you are planning on passing through Paris; they have a wide selection of francophone but also anglophone books, many of which are discounted. Regarding my learning of HTMl and CSS, rather than have the lessons go through one ear and out the other I thought I'd do something different this time: apply my learning in a concrete way directly. This website is the fruit of that effort. You are currently on the home page of this website. You can browse round to the other pages on this site by clicking on the images below.
